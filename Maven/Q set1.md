## diff between Maven and  Ant
Maven and Ant are both build automation tools used in software development, but they have different philosophies, features, and use cases. Here are the key differences between Maven and Ant:

1. Build Philosophy:

   - Maven: Maven follows a convention-over-configuration approach. It enforces a standard project structure and promotes best practices. It uses a declarative XML-based project file (pom.xml) to define project settings, dependencies, and build goals.
   
   - Ant: Ant is more flexible and follows a procedural approach. You write custom build scripts in XML (build.xml) to specify how your project should be built. It doesn't impose a specific project structure or enforce conventions.

2. Dependency Management:

   - Maven: Maven has built-in dependency management. It can download and manage project dependencies from remote repositories, making it easier to manage libraries and dependencies.
   
   - Ant: Ant does not provide built-in dependency management. You need to handle dependencies manually, which can be more complex and error-prone.

3. Plugin Ecosystem:

   - Maven: Maven has a rich ecosystem of plugins that extend its functionality. These plugins cover a wide range of tasks, including compiling code, running tests, generating documentation, and more.
   
   - Ant: Ant relies on custom tasks defined in your build.xml file. While you can create custom tasks or use third-party Ant libraries, the ecosystem is generally smaller and less standardized compared to Maven.

4. Scripting and Flexibility:

   - Maven: Maven is more opinionated and less flexible when it comes to build scripting. It encourages using predefined build phases and conventions.
   
   - Ant: Ant provides greater flexibility and control over build processes. You have full control over how tasks are executed and can customize the build process to meet specific project requirements.

## what is multi-module project in maven
In Maven, a multi-module project, also known as a multi-module build or a multi-module project structure, refers to a project that is organized into multiple interconnected subprojects or modules. These modules are typically related to each other and are built together as part of a larger project. Maven provides a way to manage such projects efficiently by allowing you to define a hierarchical structure for your project.

Here are the key characteristics and benefits of a multi-module project in Maven:

1. **Hierarchical Structure:** In a multi-module project, you have a parent project that contains one or more child modules. The parent project is usually responsible for managing common configurations, dependencies, and build settings shared by the child modules.

2. **Dependency Management:** Maven allows you to define dependencies between modules. This means that a module can depend on another module within the same multi-module project. Maven ensures that modules are built in the correct order based on their dependencies.

3. **Simplified Builds:** Multi-module projects simplify the build process by allowing you to build the entire project and all its modules with a single command. This ensures that all modules are built consistently with the same configuration.

4. **Code Reuse:** You can reuse code across modules within the same project. This is particularly useful for sharing libraries, common utilities, or configuration settings among multiple parts of your project.

5. **Parallel Development:** Different teams or developers can work on different modules independently. They can focus on their specific areas of expertise without affecting other parts of the project.

To create a multi-module project in Maven, you typically set up a parent project and define child modules within the parent's POM (Project Object Model) file. The parent POM can inherit common configurations and dependencies, while each child module can specify its unique settings.

Here's a simplified example of a multi-module project structure:

```
my-multi-module-project/
├── pom.xml (Parent POM)
├── module-1/
│   ├── pom.xml
│   ├── src/
├── module-2/
│   ├── pom.xml
│   ├── src/
└── module-3/
    ├── pom.xml
    ├── src/
```

In this example, "my-multi-module-project" is the parent project, and "module-1," "module-2," and "module-3" are child modules. The parent POM defines common settings, while each child module specifies its unique configurations. Maven takes care of building, packaging, and managing dependencies among these modules.

## What is dependency mgmt in maven
In Maven, dependency management refers to the process of specifying and managing external libraries (dependencies) that your project relies on. Maven helps automate the resolution, download, and integration of these dependencies into your project during the build process. This is a critical aspect of Maven, as it simplifies the management of libraries and ensures that your project uses the correct versions of dependencies.

Here's how dependency management works in Maven:

1. **Dependency Declaration**: You declare the dependencies your project needs in the project's POM (Project Object Model) file using the `<dependencies>` section. Each dependency includes information such as the library's group ID, artifact ID, and version. For example:

    ```xml
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.example</groupId>
            <artifactId>my-library</artifactId>
            <version>1.0.0</version>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
    ```

2. **Dependency Resolution**: When you build your project, Maven checks the declared dependencies against a central repository (e.g., Maven Central Repository) and other configured repositories to find the required JAR files. It also checks for transitive dependencies, which are dependencies of your dependencies.

3. **Downloading Dependencies**: Maven automatically downloads the required JAR files (and their transitive dependencies) and stores them in a local repository on your machine. These downloaded dependencies are cached locally for future builds, reducing the need to re-download them.

4. **Version Management**: Maven helps manage dependency versions by allowing you to specify version ranges, specific versions, or even exclude certain transitive dependencies. This ensures that your project uses compatible versions of libraries and minimizes version conflicts.

5. **Parent POM and Inheritance**: In multi-module projects (where you have a parent project and child modules), you can manage dependencies in the parent POM. Child modules inherit these dependencies, simplifying management across multiple modules.

6. **Plugin Integration**: Maven integrates with plugins, such as the Maven Compiler Plugin and the Maven Surefire Plugin, to ensure that dependencies are properly used during compilation, testing, and other phases of the build lifecycle.

By using Maven's dependency management, you can easily declare, resolve, and incorporate external libraries into your project, ensuring that your application has all the necessary components and that version conflicts are minimized. This simplifies the process of building, maintaining, and sharing Java projects, as well as enhancing their reliability and consistency.

## what is Transitive dependecy in maven?
In Maven, transitive dependencies are dependencies that are automatically included in your project because they are required by one or more of your project's direct dependencies. These indirect dependencies are not explicitly declared in your project's POM (Project Object Model) file but are pulled in by Maven to ensure that your project can function correctly with its declared dependencies.

Here's how transitive dependencies work in Maven:

1. **Direct Dependency**: You specify the direct dependencies your project needs in the `<dependencies>` section of your project's POM file. These are the libraries your project directly relies on.

   ```xml
   <dependencies>
       <dependency>
           <groupId>com.example</groupId>
           <artifactId>my-library</artifactId>
           <version>1.0.0</version>
       </dependency>
   </dependencies>
   ```

2. **Transitive Dependency**: When you declare a direct dependency, it may have its own dependencies that are required for it to work properly. Maven automatically identifies and resolves these transitive dependencies.

   For example, if "my-library" depends on another library, "other-library," Maven will also download and include "other-library" as a transitive dependency in your project.

3. **Dependency Tree**: You can view the dependency tree of your project, including transitive dependencies, using the `mvn dependency:tree` command. This command provides a visual representation of all the dependencies in your project and how they are related.

   ```
   mvn dependency:tree
   ```

4. **Version Conflict Resolution**: Sometimes, you may encounter situations where different direct dependencies rely on different versions of the same transitive dependency. In such cases, Maven will attempt to resolve version conflicts by selecting a compatible version based on dependency resolution rules and your POM's declarations. You can also explicitly specify versions or use the `<dependencyManagement>` section in your POM to control which version of a transitive dependency to use.

Transitive dependencies are a powerful feature of Maven because they simplify the management of dependencies. You don't need to manually list every single library your project indirectly relies on; Maven handles this automatically. However, it's essential to be aware of transitive dependencies and their versions to ensure that your project's dependencies are compatible and that there are no unexpected conflicts or issues.

## what are build lifecyle in maven
In Maven, a build lifecycle is a series of phases that define the sequence in which the goals (tasks) are executed during a project's build process. Each build lifecycle is responsible for a specific set of tasks related to building, testing, packaging, and deploying the project. The Maven build lifecycle is divided into three primary lifecycles, each comprising several phases:

1. **Clean Lifecycle**:
   
   - **clean**: Deletes the target directory, which contains the build artifacts.

2. **Default Lifecycle**:

   - **validate**: Checks the project's structure and dependencies.
   - **compile**: Compiles the project's source code.
   - **test**: Runs unit tests.
   - **package**: Packages the compiled code into a distributable format (e.g., JAR, WAR).
   - **integration-test**: Runs integration tests on the packaged code.
   - **verify**: Performs additional checks on the package.
   - **install**: Installs the package into the local repository.
   - **deploy**: Copies the package to a remote repository.

3. **Site Lifecycle**:

   - **site**: Generates project documentation, reports, and a project website.
   - **site-deploy**: Deploys the project website to a remote server.
   - 
Maven plugins are responsible for carrying out the tasks associated with each phase of the build lifecycle. For example, the Maven Compiler Plugin handles the compilation of source code during the `compile` phase, and the Maven Surefire Plugin is responsible for running unit tests during the `test` phase.

## What is POM 
"POM" can have various meanings in different contexts. In the realm of software development and technology, "POM" most commonly stands for "Project Object Model." Here's what it means in this context:

**Project Object Model (POM)**:

1. **Maven POM**:
   - In the context of Apache Maven, a popular build automation and project management tool used primarily for Java projects, the POM refers to the "Project Object Model." The POM is an XML file (usually named `pom.xml`) that defines the configuration, dependencies, and build settings for a Maven project.
   - The POM file includes information about the project's version, group ID, artifact ID, dependencies on external libraries, plugins, and other build-related settings. Maven uses this file to manage project dependencies, compile code, run tests, and package the project into distributable formats (e.g., JAR files, WAR files).

## In mvn is it achivable to not stored in .m2 folder and stroe in some other folder?
Yes, in Maven, you can specify a custom local repository location where Maven stores downloaded dependencies and plugins instead of the default `.m2` folder. This can be useful in scenarios where you want to manage your local repository location or keep it separate from the default location.

To configure a custom local repository location in Maven, you can do one of the following:

1. **Maven Settings (`settings.xml`):** You can configure the custom local repository location in your `settings.xml` file, which is typically found in the `conf` directory of your Maven installation or in your user's home directory (`~/.m2/settings.xml`).

   Add the following `<localRepository>` element within the `<settings>` section of your `settings.xml` file:

   ```xml
   <settings>
       ...
       <localRepository>/path/to/your/custom/repository</localRepository>
       ...
   </settings>
   ```

   Replace `/path/to/your/custom/repository` with the actual file path to your desired custom repository location.

2. **Command-Line Option:** You can specify a custom local repository location on the command line when executing Maven goals. This approach overrides the configuration in the `settings.xml` for that specific build. Use the `-Dmaven.repo.local` option:

   ```sh
   mvn -Dmaven.repo.local=/path/to/your/custom/repository clean install
   ```

   This command tells Maven to use the custom repository location `/path/to/your/custom/repository` for the current build.

By configuring a custom local repository location, you have more control over where Maven stores and retrieves dependencies and plugins. This can be useful in various scenarios, such as when you want to manage local repositories for different projects separately or when you want to share a repository among multiple developers on the same machine.

## what is GAVS in maven?
In Maven, GAVS stands for Group ID, Artifact ID, Version, and Packaging. It's a combination of four essential coordinates used to uniquely identify and locate a specific component or module within a Maven repository. These coordinates are crucial for managing dependencies and specifying the characteristics of a project or artifact.

Here's what each part of the GAVS acronym represents:

1. **Group ID (`G`):** The Group ID is typically a reverse domain name or a unique identifier for the group or organization that is responsible for the project or artifact. It helps prevent naming conflicts between different organizations' artifacts. For example, "com.example" could be a Group ID for a project.

2. **Artifact ID (`A`):** The Artifact ID is the name of the specific component or module that is part of the project. It is unique within the context of the Group ID and is used to distinguish different artifacts within the same group. For example, "my-library" could be an Artifact ID for a Java library.

3. **Version (`V`):** The Version specifies the version of the artifact. Maven uses version numbers to distinguish different releases or snapshots of the same artifact. Versions can follow semantic versioning (e.g., "1.0.0") or use other versioning schemes.

4. **Packaging (`S`):** The Packaging indicates the type of artifact that is being produced or consumed. Common packaging types include JAR (Java Archive), WAR (Web Application Archive), POM (Project Object Model), and others. The packaging type corresponds to the file format of the artifact.

When combined, GAVS provides a unique identifier for a specific artifact in the Maven repository. For example, if you have an artifact with the GAVS coordinates:

- Group ID: `com.example`
- Artifact ID: `my-library`
- Version: `1.0.0`
- Packaging: `jar`

This information specifies the exact version of the "my-library" artifact produced by the "com.example" group, and it indicates that the artifact is packaged as a JAR file. Maven uses these coordinates to fetch the correct artifact from remote repositories, manage dependencies, and ensure that the right versions are used in your project.
