## Introduction 👋

Go, also known as Golang, is a statically typed and compiled programming language designed for simplicity and efficiency. It's great for building scalable and high-performance applications.

## Setting Up Go Environment 🛠️

To get started, you need to set up the Go environment on your machine. Follow the instructions in this section to install and configure Go.

## Hello, World! 👋🌍

Let's start coding! We'll create a simple "Hello, World!" program to get familiar with the basic syntax and structure of a Go program.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```
