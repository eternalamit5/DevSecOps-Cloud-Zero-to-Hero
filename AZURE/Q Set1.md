## How does the Azure DevOps CI/CD Pipeline look in your organization ?

## You need to securely store API keys and other secrets used in your pipeline tasks. How would you ensure their protection while maintaining pipeline functionality?

## Your application uses Docker containers. How would you integrate ACR with Azure Pipelines for building, pushing, and deploying container images?

## Your pipeline consistently fails at a specific stage. How would you approach troubleshooting and identifying the root cause of the issue?

## You discover a critical bug in the recently deployed production environment. How would you leverage Azure Pipelines for a rollback and ensure safe merging of a fix?

## Your company has specific infrastructure requirements and needs to run pipelines on self-hosted machines. How would you leverage Azure Runners for this purpose?

## Your team has various roles with different access needs. How would you configure RBAC within Azure Pipelines to ensure users have appropriate permissions?

## You want to automate infrastructure provisioning and deployment alongside your application code. How would you integrate infrastructure as code (IaC) tools like Terraform with Azure Pipelines?

## How would you ensure overall security within your Azure Pipelines throughout the CI/CD process, from code building to deployment?
