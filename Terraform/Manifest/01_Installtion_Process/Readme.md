### Step 1: Install Terraform
Ensure that Terraform is installed on your machine. You can download it from the official website: [Terraform Downloads](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html).

### Step 2: Set Up AWS Credentials
Make sure you have your AWS credentials configured. You can set them up by creating an AWS access key and secret key. Set the credentials using the AWS CLI or environment variables.

```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your_access_key"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your_secret_key"
```
