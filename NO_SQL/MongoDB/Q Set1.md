1. **What is MongoDB?**
   - MongoDB is a NoSQL database that provides high performance, high availability, and easy scalability. It stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents.
MongoDB is a NoSQL database that provides high performance, high availability, and easy scalability. It stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents.

2. **Explain the difference between SQL and NoSQL databases.**
   - SQL databases are relational and use a structured schema, while NoSQL databases like MongoDB are non-relational and use a flexible schema for data storage.

3. **How does MongoDB ensure high availability?**
   - MongoDB ensures high availability through features like replica sets. A replica set consists of multiple nodes, and data is replicated across these nodes. If one node fails, another can take over, ensuring continuous availability.

4. **What is sharding in MongoDB?**
   - Sharding is the process of distributing data across multiple machines to improve performance and scalability. MongoDB uses sharding to horizontally scale a database by partitioning data across multiple servers.

5. **Explain the concept of indexing in MongoDB.**
   - Indexes in MongoDB are similar to indexes in relational databases. They help improve query performance by allowing the database to quickly locate and retrieve specific documents.

6. **How do you perform backups in MongoDB?**
   - MongoDB provides several methods for backups, including mongodump and file system snapshots. It's important to regularly back up data to ensure data recovery in case of failures.

7. **What is the role of the WiredTiger storage engine in MongoDB?**
   - WiredTiger is the default storage engine for MongoDB. It provides features like document-level concurrency control and compression, which contribute to improved performance and efficiency.

8. **Explain the significance of the Oplog in MongoDB.**
   - The Oplog (Operation Log) in MongoDB is a special collection that records all write operations that modify data. It is crucial for replication and maintaining data consistency across replica sets.

9. **How can you secure MongoDB deployments?**
   - MongoDB can be secured through authentication, authorization, encryption, and other security measures. It's essential to configure access control, enable authentication mechanisms, and use SSL/TLS for encrypted communication.

10. **Discuss the considerations for upgrading MongoDB.**
    - Upgrading MongoDB involves careful planning. Considerations include checking compatibility, testing in a non-production environment, and having a rollback plan in case of issues.

11. **Explain the steps involved in scaling a MongoDB database.**
    - Scaling MongoDB can be achieved through vertical scaling (upgrading hardware) or horizontal scaling (sharding). Understanding the application's requirements and choosing the appropriate scaling strategy is important.

12. **How can you monitor and optimize MongoDB performance?**
    - Monitoring tools like MongoDB Cloud Manager or Ops Manager can be used to track performance metrics. Optimization involves index tuning, proper schema design, and understanding query execution plans.
